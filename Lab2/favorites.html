    <p>I'm a Video Buff. I grew up without TV, unless you count SnowBlown PBS on Rabbit Ears! <br>
    These days I watch EVERYTHING! If I had to pick a favorite: <br>
    I've watched the Disney <i><span class="Favorite-Movie-Title">Cars</span></i> movie exactly 28 times. <br>

      isn't all it's made out to be!<br>
